# Snake Game

This console-based Snake game in C++ uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). The game consists of three main classes: `point`, `Snake`, and `Board`. The `point` class represents coordinates on the board. The `Snake` class models the snake with attributes for length, direction, and body, and methods for changing direction and moving. The `Board` class manages the game, handling the snake and food, updating the game state, and drawing the game. To play, compile the code with a C++ compiler and run the executable.
